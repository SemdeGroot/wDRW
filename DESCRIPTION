Description: Provides an implementation of the Weighted Directed Random Walk (wDRW) algorithm
    for quantifying activity of gene co-expression network modules. The method integrates
    WGCNA topological overlap matrices with directed random walk propagation to produce
    network-aware module activity scores that can serve as an alternative to classical
    eigengene-based module summaries. Suitable for use in transcriptomics pipelines where
    biologically meaningful module quantification is needed.
